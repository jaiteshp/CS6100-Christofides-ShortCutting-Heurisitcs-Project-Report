Several $O(n), O(n^2)$ short-cutting heuristics are described which are used in Christofides' algorithm for solving n-city travelling salesman problems whose cost matrix satisfies the triangularity condition. The Christofides' algorithm invovles computation of a shortest spanning tree of the graph G defining the TSP, and finding the minimum cost perfect matching of a certaing induced subgraph of G.
